\section{Summary} \label{sec:summary}
In conclusion, managing the CECS labs is a difficult task made easier by using efficient management. We have problems to resolve on all fronts from staff and faculty turnover to constant updates. This is all made easier through automation and careful crafting of our infrastructure.  

For documentation, we use a shared user account and store instructions there.  We maintain a support website and shared technical support email.  Our infrastructure consists of fileservers and printservers.  Our install process involves creating a master lab image and cloning it to many workstations over the network.  Maintenance during the semester is done via Secure Shell pushes and periodic automated cleaning.  Lastly, we maintain a mixed environment with many different platforms across regular labs and specialty labs.  Maintaining all of this can be challenging, but we make it easier through automation.
