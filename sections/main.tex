% READ ME, PLEASE !!!!
% This document is based on the LaTeX format of Mark T. McLaughlin's thesis
% which was made with WinEdt 5.4, October 2005.  This top section is his
% comments.
%
% 1) IF YOU CAN'T FORMAT SOME PART OF YOUR THESIS ACCORDING TO THE CSULB
%    THESIS GUIDELINES:   DON'T WORRY!!
%    Just rewrite the crap in MSWord. The command, \usepackage{times}
%    puts everything in the same font as the times roman used by MSWord
%
% 2) There are a few SMALL PROBLEMS with the
%    table of contents, list of figures, and list of tables. The problems are
%    a) appendix subhead titles are not supposed to be included in the table of
%    contents, b) figures in the appendices are not supposed to be included
%    in the list of figures, and c) tables in the appendices are not supposed to be
%    included in the list of tables. -EASY SOLUTION: Make up a phony appendix, say
%    phonyAppendixA, which is blank, but the same number of pages as your real
%    appendix A. (Similarly, do the same with appendix B, appendix C, etc...)
%    Then at the end of this file, main.tex, comment out your real
%    appendix A, and uncomment this phony appendix when you LaTex your document
%    for the purposes of generating a table of contents, list of figures, and
%    list of tables. Then when you want to LaTex the rest of your real document,
%    comment out your phony appendices, and uncomment your real appendices.
%
% Everything else passed the thesis office inspection!!! -Bibliography, Signature page,
% Equation numbering, figures, tables, margins, all that junk......
% Thanks Yamato Matsuoka for creating such a nice thesis template!

% MORE HELPFUL STUFF:
% TIPS FOR MAKING FIGURES AND TABLES
%   AUTOCAD:
%       In Windows: autocad -> HP color laserjet postscript -> print to filename.ps
%       In Linux: pstoedit -f xfig filename.ps filename.fig
%                 xfig filename.fig
%        in xfig: export -> filename.eps
%        put filename.eps in LaTex document
%
%   EXCEL: excel -> print to postscript (in printer settings click on eps postscript)
%       In Linux: pstoedit -f xfig filename.ps filename.fig
%        in xfig: export -> filename.eps
%        put filename.eps in LaTex document
