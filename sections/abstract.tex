Educational lab environments are handled quite differently from other IT environments.  

This paper describes a case study on how a specific set of Computer Science labs is maintained.  It describes how the documentation is maintained, how the lab infrastructure is set up, how the technicians managing the lab build master lab images, how all of the workstations in the lab are cloned, and how some maintenance is handled.  Additionally, this paper also describes some of the specialty labs provided for courses with specialized topics.
