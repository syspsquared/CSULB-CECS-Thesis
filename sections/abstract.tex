University lab environments are handled differently than corporate, government, and commercial Information Technology (IT) environments.  While all environments have the common issues of scalability and cross platform interoperability, education lab environments must additionally handle student permissions, student files, student printing, and special education labs.  The emphasis is on uniformity across lab machines for a uniform course curriculum. 

This thesis construes how a specific set of Computer Science labs is maintained.  It describes how the documentation is maintained, how the lab infrastructure is setup, how the technicians managing the lab build master lab images, how all of the workstations in the lab are cloned, and how a portion of the maintenance is handled.  Additionally, this paper also describes some of the specialty labs provided for courses with functional topics.
