GENERAL INSTALL (UBUNTU)

Power up, Hit F2 during boot to get BIOS
Under boot, removable is first, cdrom is second, hard drive is third 
Boot from CD.
Also (while you are modifying the BIOS) enable boot at power up

Ubuntu Server menu:
  This auto selects F2 (set up the language)
    Select English
  When you are done with that overlay the main menu is back on top
    F1..F6 are now available
   TASK: explore the F6 (Expert install) option
   TASK: explore the F4 (OEM mode) option
  Select "Install Ubuntu Server" (other options not explored)
  Seems to crank up the installer, doesn't seem to be a full Linux boot.
  Asks for non-free firmware files (Dell). Seems to be fine ignored.

Setup Users:
  user: configure password: configure, don't encrypt home dir
  This account will be removed later.

Choose Language, set up keyboard (use defaults)

Network configurations:
  In the tech shop we can let "auto configuration" proceed
   Elsewhere you may hit cancel to get "manual configuration"
   and manually the IP, name and domain

Setting up clock:
  Automatic ntp should work otherwise Manual: Pacific

Partition disks.
 Select manual
  Delete all existing partitions.
    If you have logical volumes you may need to zero out the front of
    the disk (dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda count=300000) and hit the reboot
    button (not the command, that gives it a chance to rewrite the disk).
  Set up partitions (I did ext2 90%, swap rest).
  If you missed it when you set it up or it was already setup
  Select the Linux partition (select and hit enter)
    Use as: ext2
    Format the partition
    Mount point: /
    Bootable flag: on
  Select the swap partition
    Use as: swap

(The base system is installed at this time)

Http proxy: (none) leave blank and continue
No auto updates

Select and install software:  (extra stuff using apt-get)
  LAMP, openssh, (print server not needed);
   You go to a menu driven version of apt-get.

  Configure some of the "extra stuff" so it installs correctly.
    mysql: root user password "xyzmysql"

Install complete:
  if the cdrom doesn't get ejected or gets sucked back in
    alt-F2:
     eject /dev/cdrom,  remove it from tray
    alt-F1:
     select continue (to reboot)
  else
    remove cd from tray

If you really want to see what is installed:
  dpkg --get-selections
  will report the names of the packages.

WEB SERVER SETUP

Get rid of the mysql database server
  apt-get -y remove mysql-server mysql-server-5.5 mysql-server-core-5.5
  (Or whatever version comes up from dpkg --get-selections)

An update will reenable service, so, after the install and after additional
 packages have been installed/removed:
  apt-get -y update         # locate the latest versions
  apt-get -y dist_upgrade   # install the latest versions

Get extra shells
  apt-get -y install tcsh ksh zsh

  apt-get -y ntp

Set up the time service
 edit /etc/ntp.conf  
   server 134.139.248.10
   server 134.139.248.8
  Note: the clock will jump if the machine is on the network at boot,
  (i.e., when ntpd starts) but will not jump if it is attached after boot.

configure the apache web service
 enable ~ directories
  cd /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
  ln -s ../mods-available/userdir.load
  ln -s ../mods-available/userdir.conf
 enable https
  cd /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
  ln -s ../mods-available/ssl.load
  ln -s ../mods-available/ssl.conf
  cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
  ln -s ../sites-available/default-ssl
 enable cgi scripts.
  vi /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/mime.conf
   uncomment "AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
  vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/default (and default-ssl)
  vi /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/userdir.conf
   append to "Options"  "ExecCGI"
   set UserDir to htdocs
   switch the /Directory from /homes to /net/*
 enable server side includes:
  cd /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
  ln -s ../mods-available/include.load
  vi /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/mime.conf
   uncomment "AddType text/html .shtml" and "AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml"
    (12.04 uncommented by default)
  vi /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/userdir.conf
   append to "Options"  "Includes"
    (12.04 replaced IncludesNoExec)
 allow your default file to be a server side include
  vi /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf
    append index.shtml to the DirectoryIndex list
 activate (if testing the install incrementally)
  apache2ctl restart

set up the site home page
  vi /var/www/index.html
    (put something reasonable in this file like "CECS"
     "all content on this server is in user home directories")

nfs setup
 apt-get -y install nfs-common autofs
 vi /etc/auto.master to have:
  /net/d1 /etc/auto.d1
  /net/d2 /etc/auto.d2
  /net/d3 /etc/auto.d3
 vi /etc/auto.d1 (d2 and d3) to have:
  u1 -soft,intr d1.cecs.csulb.edu:/u1
  u2 -soft,intr d1.cecs.csulb.edu:/u2
  u3 -soft,intr d1.cecs.csulb.edu:/u3
  u4 -soft,intr d1.cecs.csulb.edu:/u4
  u5 -soft,intr d1.cecs.csulb.edu:/u5
  u6 -soft,intr d1.cecs.csulb.edu:/u6
  u7 -soft,intr d1.cecs.csulb.edu:/u7
 reboot to activate
 Alternatively, download from tiger: 
  wget http://tiger/export/ubuntu/autofs.tgz
  comment out aardvark, charlotte and a1 from auto.master and
   remove references to the backup servers

yp setup
 apt-get -y install nis
 vi /etc/defaultdomain to contain:
  cecsyp
 vi /etc/yp.conf   (set brain as the ypserver)
   ypserver 134.139.249.2
    during testing, to avoid brain's security blocking, use:
   ypserver psvr416.cecs.csulb.edu
 vi /etc/nsswitch.conf:
   passwd, shadow, group should be "files nis"
 vi /etc/group (edit, removing former names for the groups)
   staff:x:10
   faculty:x:30
   student:x:40

inetd setup (does not seem to be installed anymore)
 vi /etc/inetd.conf:
   Shutdown just about everything, including telnet and the r commands.
   This is now the default.

sshd setup
 vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config add:
  AllowGroups faculty staff configure 
   the last is temporary
 limit ssh access to just tech shop
  vi /etc/hosts.allow   should be the line:
   sshd,rpc.statd:134.139.249.128/255.255.255.192
  vi /etc/hosts.deny   should be the line:
   sshd,rpc.statd:ALL

set the root password
 passwd root
  (use the standard linux password format)

remove the configure user
 login as something other than configure and su to root
  remove configure from the password and shadow files
   vi /etc/passwd
   vi /etc/shadow
  remove the configure group and all references to configure from the group file
   vi /etc/group
  remove configure's home directory
   rm -r /home/configure
 or this simpler way of doing all the above
  deluser --remove-home --remove-all-files configure

DO THE FOLLOWING ONLY WHEN READY TO MOVE THE BOX TO THE SERVER ROOM
  (No need to do this if building in the server room)
 configure the network:
   The names and numbers are negotiated with Larry.
  vi /etc/hostname
   prometheus2
  vi /etc/network/interfaces
   change the entry for eth0 from dhcp to
    iface eth0 inet static
     address 134.139.249.83 
     netmask 255.255.255.192
     gateway 134.139.249.65

 Roll over:
  DO THIS ONLY WHEN READY TO USE THE BOX AS THE MAIN SERVER
  /etc/hostname
    change to prometheus (or nike for student server)
  /etc/network/interfaces
    change address to 134.139.249.82 (or 134.139.249.66 for student server)
