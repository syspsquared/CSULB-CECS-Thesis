Overall:
The proper use of tense needs to be fixed in many places.
Past tense: things we have done.
Present tense: things we are doing (and may have also done in the past).
Future tense: things we would consider (like to) do.
In many places the tense is ambiguous or incorrrect, particularly for
things that we have done or are doing.
Make it clear which items we do and which we don't.

Detail:
 The capitalization in the following text is to emphasize the changes. I
couldn't capitalize deletions, because they aren't there any more.

Chapter 1 Overview:
Page 1:
Each of the techNICIANS specializes in certain topicS.
  -spell our words, do not imply each technician has only one speciality
  -also standardize on either "technicians" or "lab staff" as the word to use

Some of these are beyond our control while FOR others we HAVE FOUND
effecient solutions.
  -sentences don't end in prepositions, make it clear this is something
   we've done.

The Problem:
Page 2:
The first sentence refers to "lab images"; which haven't been mentioned yet.
 -Add a first section "The need for bulk installs". With this many machines
  installing them individually isn't too time consuming to be practical.

Requests for changes...build the lab IMAGES come ...

In any case...for the TECHNICIANS because...
 -the "us" was too far from to whom it referred

"We also have a relative fast...the semester starts" REPLACE
Although we can re-clone the labs during the semester, cloning
requires prohibiting access to the lab during the cloning process which
denies access lab access to classes.

...ignore requests until the next iteration of lab imaging.
  -deletions, simplified the sentence

Mixed Environment:
Page 3
Add: "and several specialty labs." or "In addition the department supports
several specialty labs"
 -We do mention them later, but I think we need to mention them here.

Our servers THAT SUPPORT THE LABS are also running different...

Frequent Software Updates:
Page 3:
 Make this part of the new first section "bulk installs"

Updates while courses...are RISKY because
  -difficult is the wrong word here

Partial Solution:
Page 4:
Dispite the problems we do as much as we can...
 -simplify the sentence

In the chapter on "Documentation Solution,"  I will describe...
 -more formal way of wording it

Chapter 2 Documentation:

Overview
Page 5:
...created a user CALLED "conf"...

The user conf WAS created...
 -the tense should imply we have already done this, not that we could do it.

...network user account, it IS available...
 -tense

Fix Utilities

Page 10:
FOR EXAMPLE, a script called "resetX" EXISTS in conf's home directory
"~conf/" and IS world executable.
 -tenses is wrong, the ~disappeared

Page 11:
If the script is somewhat more permanent, it is easier to make the script part
of th master image which will causes copies of the scripts to be found
on every machine."

Print Servers:
Overview:
Page 12
--Replace the starting sentence of the overview
Since the user accounts are available on all machines in all labs,
servers are essential to allow an (almost) seamless transition of students
between labs.
WE HAVE DISCOVERED THAT HAVING A SERVER IN EACH LAB HAS DISTINCT ADVANTAGES
OVER HAVING ONLY CENTRAL SERVERS.

This server should PROVIDE a variety of SERVICES to client machines in the lab.

In the CECS labs, the OLDEST AND most obvious function for these servers was
printing, so THEY ARE CALLED print servers AND HAVE NAMES with the...
by the room number, SUCH AS psvr408.

DELETE the "Printing is.. "sentence

IN ADDITION TO PRINTING THESE SERVERS ALSO PROVIDE: DHCP, TFTP, PXE boot,
Samba...
 -note: although they run NFS they do not provide NFS service to the lab.

DHCPD server
page 12
 --the sentence structure would be better as
EITHER the DHCPD SERVER has to be on the same subnet as the clients OR
THE ROUTERS NEED TO BE CONFIGURED TO ACT AS DHCP FORWARDERS.

IN EITHER CASE clients send...
 -Delete sentences "It is possible...layer 3...protocol. This protocol...
   returned"

we prever to keep DHCPD AS WELL AS MANY OTHER SERVICES on the same subnet
TO RELIEVE BANDWIDTH CONGESTION GOING INTO THE MAIN SERVERS AND THAT in the
event...lost, THE LAB can still at least partially function locally.

In addition, ...
  The wording in this paragraph needs to be fixed. The server doesn't have
  to hand out addresses based on MAC addresses, we have it do that because
  it helps our maintance. That isn't said properly in this paragraph.

page 13
The sentence:
 The disadvantage to this is...
 -I'm not sure what you are trying to say here, needs a rewording.

Netbooting
I would reword the first sentence as:
Cloning has become one of the most important uses of the print servers
in the labs.

DHCP is required...
 DHCP also supports the bootp protocol which is the protocol used to boot.

Network File System

 -emphasizing more that don't. Print servers don't export so we aren't setu
 to so this.

The Samba server requires a fair amount of CPU, memory resources AND
NETWORK BANDWIDTH to do ...
SO WE KEEP THE SMB TRAFFIC LOCAL TO THE LABS AND have equi9pped the Print
Servers WITH quad core processors..

(This generates unnecessary network traffic when a mount is not being used.)
 -Delete the sentence, it's not true.

If a mount fails, FOR EXAMPLE THE FILE SERVER GOES OFFLINE, THE CLIENT will
not remount...

Further action can be taken ONLY by the faculty AND/OR ADMINISTRATORS.

Lab Printing

Printing Setup
page 21
...(which is descripted in THE SECTION ON PRINT SERVERS)...
 -doesn't hurt to be specific here

page 22
 "paperd" and "prmaster" in quotes the first time used

 -QUOTE HINT  ``prmaster", the `` gives you the opening quote mark.

TO BE ABLE TO CREDIT A USER'S PAPER ACCOUNT A USER MUST BE A MEMBER OF
THE PRMASTER GROUP which has the ability to run the modpaper exam
AND MUST HAVE BE ALLOWED ACCESS TO THE SERVER ON WHITH THE MODPAPER COMMAND
IS HOUSED.

--The last two sentences of the last paragraph in this section are not clear.
-Is what you want to say that the default printer is in the same room as
 the machine, but they are allowed to send it elsewhere.

Printing issues
page23
More importantly we only track paper...
 -you can't track the other stuff, however you could charge for it on
  a per page basis. It's that we were only recoupping the paper cost
  and not the other costs that hurt.

This SHOULD give us a significant portion...

However, this cost IS transferred
 -I think that's a better wording

 -Say something about Unix printing not yet being handled by this system.

 (The worst situation...This takes...worth) 
 -delete two sentences and replace with
 With the number of machines we have present in the labs, installing
 each machine individually would require far more staff time than we

 between lab machines.

Files system checks (FSCK) occur occasionally on reboot.
--Redo as
On Ubuntu the default if the file system check detects an error is to
halt the boot and go into single user mode so the administrator can
examine each error message before allowing the file system check to fix it.
This visual examination doesn't need to be done in our labs where most such
errors are because a student undid the power plug so we have modified the
behavior to tell the file system check to automatically fix all errors.

Verbose mode...

We have also found booting in verbose mode is very helpful...for
troubleshooting machines SO WE CONFIGURED OUR MACHINES TO THAT BEHAVIOR.
