A common topic in computer security is system hardening.  This paper discusses some of the more common system vulnerabilities and how to harden them against attack.  It is not an exhaustive study on the subject but rather a set of guidelines for System and Network Administrators to consider.  Topics covered include denial of service, insufficient authentication mechanisms, poor assignment of privileges, unencrypted services, physical security, and some best practices for securing servers.
