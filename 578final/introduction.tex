\section{The Problem} \label{sec:problem}
System hardening is the practice of securing a workstation or server against attack.  These attacks could happen both on the system or remotely.

Since IT professionals do not always have access to source code or lack the necessary programming knowledge, they are only concerned with software usage and configuration.
