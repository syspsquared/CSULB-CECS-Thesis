-Revise abstract again
-Make more general:
  universities face this problem, then the problem statement
  more on repetitive tasks such as imaging. 
  

-lead into case study with the CECS labs.
-Conclusion should match the abstract. Touch on items again.

-Overall: add some figures. Ssh wouldn't hurt.

Problem statement: Given limited staff, solutions must scale, and things that don't scale should be minimum.
